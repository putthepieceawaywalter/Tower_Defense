# Tower_Defense
This is a position defense Android game made by Patrick McDaniel for his Senior Project at Oregon Institute of Technology.  This will cover courses CST 412, CST 422 and CST 432.


This is an augmented reality game where the user holds their Android device in front of them. When the user rotates their body or moves their phone up or down it pans the
camera around in a 3d environment.  The player cannot move their character, only adjust where the camera is pointed.  There will be various levels where a variety
of enemies advance towards the user, it is the users's objective to shoot them before they reach the user.  If an enemy reaches the user they will attack the user
until the user's health is reduced to 0.  The user will be scored based on their performance on each level.  After each level they will have the opportunity to
purchase upgraded weapons for the upcoming level. The user's performance will be graded on things such as how much health they lost, and how quickly they complete the
level.
